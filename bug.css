The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the `calc()` function does not correctly handle the addition of percentages and pixels when applied to the `width` property:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
}
```

The expected behavior is for the div to occupy 50% of its container's width plus an additional 20 pixels. However, some browsers might interpret this incorrectly, leading to unexpected layout behavior.  The issue stems from the limitations of how `calc()` handles mixed units in some older browser versions or specific rendering contexts.
